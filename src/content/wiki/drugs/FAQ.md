## Where can I obtain drugs?

### Darknet
- A number of microdosers still source their substances from the Darknet/Darkweb, particularly LSD, its analogs, and various research chemicals. In the past, there were more guides and discussions on Reddit, but many of those communities have been banned due to the illicit nature of the Darknet market. You'll also need a cryptocurrency that is accepted for transactions. While some people report having no issues with receiving orders, others have had their packages flagged by customs. Legal risks vary depending on where you live, so it's always best to stick to substances that are legal in your area, when possible.

### Mushrooms
- If it's legal where you are, growing your own mushrooms is a straightforward process. If you can follow a recipe, you can grow mushrooms. Great resources for learning how to grow include The Shroomery, [r/MushroomGrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/MushroomGrowers/), and [r/shrooms](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/). You can find spores from sources like the Free Spore Ring Earth or Free Spore Ring Espana.

### Research Chemicals
- Information about research chemicals can be found at ResearchChemicals, although the original sourcing community for these has since been banned.

## Does using drugs help with depression?
- Addressing depression is a highly personal matter, and what works for one person might not work for another. There's no one-size-fits-all solution for managing life's challenges.

## Does using drugs help with anxiety?
- The response is similar to depression: it depends entirely on the individual.
