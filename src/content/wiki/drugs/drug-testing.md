## **How to Test Drugs for Fentanyl Using Fentanyl Test Strips**

Fentanyl test strips (FTS) are a simple and effective way to detect fentanyl in drugs, reducing the risk of overdose. Here's how to use them correctly:

---

### **What You'll Need:**
- A fentanyl test strip
- A small amount of the drug (e.g., heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA)
- Clean water (preferably distilled or bottled)
- A small container (e.g., a bottle cap)
- A tissue or paper towel

---

### **How to Perform the Test:**
1. **Dissolve a small sample of the drug**
    - If testing a powder or crystal substance, dissolve a small amount (**about the size of a pinhead**) in approximately **5 ml of water** (**about one teaspoon**).
    - If testing a pill, crush it into powder and dissolve it the same way.
    - For liquid drugs (e.g., liquid heroin), you can test directly.

2. **Dip the test strip**
    - Hold the strip by the unmarked end and **dip it into the solution for about 15 seconds**.
    - The strip should be submerged **up to the line marked "MAX"**.

3. **Place the strip on a dry surface**
    - After removing the strip, lay it flat on a surface and wait **about 2 minutes** for the results to appear.

### **Interpreting the Results:**
✅ **Negative (No Fentanyl Detected)** → **Two lines**  
❌ **Positive (Fentanyl Detected)** → **One line**  
⚠️ **Invalid Test** → No line or unclear result → Repeat the test with a new strip.

---

### **Important Tips:**
- **FTS can be highly sensitive**, so always use a sufficient amount of water.
- Fentanyl may not be evenly distributed in a batch, so **testing the entire dose is the safest option**.
- **If the test is positive**, avoid using the substance or proceed with extreme caution (e.g., use a smaller dose, have naloxone ready).
- Even **a negative result is not a 100% guarantee of safety**, as test strips may not detect all fentanyl analogs.
